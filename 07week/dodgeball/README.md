We are in need of a sorting and organizing app for our community dodge ball league. There are already 6 players signed up and we hope to get more! We need to select from our currently sign-up people to make them dodge ball players and from there we need to be able to select them to be on different teams.

- Code Plan - Include this in a README.md file in your folder with comment in your code.

- Can add People to Players - When clicked the people are added to the Players column and removed from the People list while getting new values of a player added to them.

- Can add Players to different Teams - When we click on the blue button they Player is added to the blue team and removed from the Player list while also getting the keys color and mascot extended to them when they are moved to a team.

- Uses Class - Use class to add the new properties you need and extend when you need.

- Minimum 3 Unit Tests - Use Mocha and Chai to give us at least 3 unit test that prove a person becomes a player and player becomes a teammate.

CHALLENGES:
- Use the class keyword to create a template of a dodgeBallPlayer that requires canThrowBall, canDodgeBall, hasPaid, isHealthy, yearsExperience

- Push these new dodge ball Player objects into a new array and then display them in the DOM as available players to pick.

- Add a button to each new player that will allow each one to be selected for either Blue Team or Read Team and now has mascot and teamColor

- Use the this keyword to assign each player to a team with an onclick. Either Blue Team or Red Team.

- Display the two teams in a new list in the DOM with appropriate titles.

- Create 3 tests for your application.
